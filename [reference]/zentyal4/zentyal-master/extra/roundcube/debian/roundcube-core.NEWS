roundcube (0.7.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

    Roundcube SQLite support is limited to SQLite 2.x. No support for
    SQLite 3.x currently exists. Unfortunately, SQLite 2.x is unmaintained
    for several years and therefore has been dropped from php5
    package.

    You need to select another database to continue to use
    Roundcube. Unfortunately, there is currently no migration script
    available. You have to start from an empty database and migrate
    data yourself if you want to keep your settings. You can find some
    directions here:
     http://wiki.debian.org/Roundcube/DeprecationOfSQLitev2

    Once the migration is done, you can remove roundcube-sqlite
    package.

roundcube (0.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    Starting from Roundcube 0.3, an incompatibility with Suhosin session
    encryption is present. This can be resolved by tuning php.ini for
    Roundcube with the "suhosin.session.encrypt" set to "Off".

    We ship a .htaccess in /var/lib/roundcube to disable this
    option. However, this only works with a webserver like Apache with
    mod_php. If you are using a webserver with PHP configured as a
    *CGI process, you need to tune the php.ini for this process:
    either turn of globally Suhosin session encryption in
    /etc/php5/conf.d/suhosin or you can provide your own php.ini to
    php5-cgi with "-c" option.
