# Network UPS Tools: example nut.conf

##############################################################################
# The MODE determines which part of the NUT is to be started, and which
# configuration files must be modified.
#
# This file try to standardize the various files being found in the field, like
# /etc/default/nut on Debian based systems, /etc/sysconfig/ups on RedHat based
# systems, ... Distribution's init script should source this file to see which
# component(s) has to be started.
#
# The values of MODE can be:
# - none: NUT is not configured, or use the Integrated Power Management, or use
#   some external system to startup NUT components. So nothing is to be started.
# - standalone: This mode address a local only configuration, with 1 UPS
#   protecting the local system. This implies to start the 3 NUT layers (driver,
#   upsd and upsmon) and the matching configuration files. This mode can also
#   address UPS redundancy.
# - netserver: same as for the standalone configuration, but also need
#   some more network access controls (firewall, tcp-wrappers) and possibly a
#   specific LISTEN directive in upsd.conf.
#   Since this MODE is opened to the network, a special care should be applied
#   to security concerns.
# - netclient: this mode only requires upsmon.
