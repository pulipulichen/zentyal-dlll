# Method: staticIfaceAddressChanged
#	Invoked when the address of an static network interface is going to
#	be changed, this method receives the old and new addresses and masks
#	as arguments. Returning a true value means that this
#	module's configuration would become inconsistent if such a change
#	was made. In that case the network module will not make the change,
#	but warn the user instead. You should override this method if you need
#	to.
#
# Parameters:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	oldaddr - old address
#	oldmask - old mask
#	newaddr - new address
#	newmask - new mask
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub staticIfaceAddressChanged # (iface, oldaddr, oldmask, newaddr, newmask)
{
        return undef;
}

# Method: externalDhcpIfaceAddressChangedDone
#
#	Invoked when the address of an external network interface has been assigned
#
# Parameters:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	oldaddr - old address
#	oldmask - old mask
#	newaddr - new address
#	newmask - new mask
#
sub externalDhcpIfaceAddressChangedDone # (iface, oldaddr, oldmask, newaddr, newmask)
{
}

# Method: internalDhcpIfaceAddressChangedDone
#
#	Invoked when the address of an internal network interface has been assigned
#
# Parameters:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	oldaddr - old address
#	oldmask - old mask
#	newaddr - new address
#	newmask - new mask
#
sub internalDhcpIfaceAddressChangedDone # (iface, oldaddr, oldmask, newaddr, newmask)
{
}

# Method: staticIfaceAddressChangedDone
#
#   Invoked when the change in the adddress of a static inteface has taken
#   place.
#
#   Iit will be called after freeIface, ifaceMethodChanged and staticIfaceAddressChanged
#   when the configuration changes have already been set.
#
# Parameters:
#
#       iface - interface name
#       oldaddr - old address
#       oldmask - old mask
#       newaddr - new address
#       newmask - new mask
#
sub staticIfaceAddressChangedDone # (iface, oldaddr, oldmask, newaddr, newmask)
{
        # default empty implementation. Subclasses should override this as
        # needed.
}

# Method: ifaceMethodChanged
#
#	Invoked when the configuration method for a network interface is
#	going to change. Both the old and new methods are passed as
#	arguments to this function. They are strings: static, dhcp,
#	trunk or notset. As with the previous function, a return value of
#	true will prevent the change from being made. You should override this
#	method if you need to.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	oldmethod - old method
#	newmethod - newmethod
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub ifaceMethodChanged # (iface, oldmethod, newmethod)
{
        return undef;
}

# Method: ifaceMethodChangeDone
#
#   Invoked when a method configuration change has taken place.
#
#   Note that it will be called after freeIface and ifaceMethodChanged
#   when the configuration changes have already been set.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#   iface - interface name
#
sub ifaceMethodChangeDone # (iface)
{
        # default empty implementation. Subclasses should override this as
        # needed.
}

# Method: ifaceExternalChanged
#
#	Invoked when a iface is going to change from external to
#	internal and viceversa. Its argument is the name of the real
#	interface. As with the previous function, a return value of
#	true will prevent the change from being made. You should override this
#	method if you need to.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#       iface - interface name
#
#       external - boolean indicating if the property is gonna set to
#       *external*
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub ifaceExternalChanged # (iface)
{
  return undef;
}

# Method: vifaceDelete
#
#	Invoked when a  virtual interface is going to be removed. Its
#	arguments are the real interface  which it's going to be removed from,
#	the name of the  interface to remove, its ip address and its netmask. It
#	works the same way: return true if the removal of the virtual
#	interface is incompatible with your module's current configuration.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	viface - virtual interface to be removed
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
#
sub vifaceDelete # (iface, viface)
{

# Method: vifaceAdded
#
#	Invoked when a new virtual interface is going to be created. Its
#	arguments are the real interface to which it's going to be added,
#	the name of the new interface, its ip address and its netmask. It
#	works the same way: return true if the creation of the virtual
#	interface is incompatible with your module's current configuration.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	viface - virtual interface to be removed
#	newmethod - newmethod
#
# Returns:
#
#	boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
sub vifaceAdded # (iface, viface, address, netmask)

# Method: changeIfaceExternalProperty
#
#        Invoked when an interface is going to change from external to
#        internal. Its argument is the name of the real interface. It
#        works exactly the same way as two methods above.
#
# Parameters:
#
#       iface    - interface name
#       external - boolean indicating in which way external is going to change
#
# Returns:
#
#       boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent, otherwise
#	false
#
sub changeIfaceExternalProperty # (iface, external)

# Method: freeIface
#
#	Invoked when an interface is going to be removed. Its argument
#	is the name of the real interface. It works exactly
#	the same way as the three methods above.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#
sub freeIface # (iface)
{
        # default empty implementation. Subclasses should override this as
        # needed.
}

# Method: freeViface
#
#	Invoked when a virtual interface is going to be removed. Its arguments
#	are the names of the real and virtual interfaces. It works exactly
#	the same way as the four methods above.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#	iface - interface name
#	viface - virtual interface to be removed
#
sub freeViface # (iface, viface)
{
        # default empty implementation. Subclasses should override this as
        # needed.
}

# Method: gatewayDelete
#
#       Invoked when a  gateway is going to be removed.
#       It  works the same way: return true if the removal of the gateway
#       is incompatible with your module's current configuration.
#
#   Parameteres:
#
#       gwName - gateway name
#
# Returns:
#
#       boolean - true if module's configuration becomes inconsistent,
#                 false otherwise
